Settings (square brackets give names of the constants)

Calibration curve: IntCal09.14C
Age-depth model: linear interpolation between dated levels [type=1]
Weighted by the calibrated probabilities [wghts=1]
Calculations at 95% confidence ranges [prob=0.95]
Amount of iterations: 1000 [its]
Calendar age point estimates for depths based on weighted average of all age-depth curves [est=1]
Calendar scale used: cal BP [BCAD=FALSE] at a resolution of 1 yr [yrsteps]

Dates assumed outlying [outliers]: 18 (beta.325704) 
A hiatus was inferred at 55.5 cm [hiatus]
