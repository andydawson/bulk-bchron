The most common tree species on the island are western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). Mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) is common, particularly in upland forests. Also present are shore pine (Pinus. contorta ssp. contorta), yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), and occasional red cedar (Thuja plicata). Red alder trees (Alnus rubra) and Sitka alder shrubs (Alnus crispa ssp. sinuata) are important elements of the island's vegetation. Red alder trees are common in lowlands, while Sitka alder shrubs often form dense thickets along rocky coastlines, along stream banks, in avalanche scars, at forest edges, and in the subalpine zone.","Palustrine"

White Pond is located in a commercially managed Pinus taeda forest, and the pond and surrounding property have been managed for at least 70 years for private hunting and fishing. Pinus echinata and Pinus palustris are also present near the site. P. palustris was probably dominant prior to land clearance. Quercus falcata, Carya, and Liquidambar sytraciflua grow on the low ground surrounding the pond, as do Acer rubrum, Vaccinium, and other mesic trees and shrubs. On exposed sandy soils east of the lake, Quercus laevis, Ceratiola ericoides, Selaginella arenicola, Opuntia, and lichens grow under open P. palustris canopy. The shallow western have of the pond is vegetated by emergent graminoids (Poaceae and Cyperaceae), while the deeper eastern half is dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (Nymphaea odorata and Brasenia schreberi).","Lacustrine"

The edge of the Joe River is lined with a fringe of Rhizophora and occasional Avicennia, while the interior portions are dominated by Conocarpus associated with Laguncularia, Sabal and several species of hardwood trees and vines. Near the edge of the forest numerous ponds are formed in the dissected surface of the marsh. Here Cladium and ferns appear to be growing under adverse conditions on a higher level provided by remnant pillars of peat, suggesting a recent lowering of the original surface by erosion. Further into the marsh fewer ponds are encountered and growth of Cladium is more vigorous.","Brackish Marsh"

"White Pond",2839,3840,90,-80.77616,34.16759,"White Pond is situated in a shallow groundwater-fed basin in the Carolina Sandhills. White Pond likely originated as a wind-excavated depression in the Sandhills. White Pond is located in a commercially managed Pinus taeda forest, and the pond and surrounding property have been managed for at least 70 years for private hunting and fishing. Pinus echinata and Pinus palustris are also present near the site. P. palustris was probably dominant prior to land clearance. Quercus falcata, Carya, and Liquidambar sytraciflua grow on the low ground surrounding the pond, as do Acer rubrum, Vaccinium, and other mesic trees and shrubs. On exposed sandy soils east of the lake, Quercus laevis, Ceratiola ericoides, Selaginella arenicola, Opuntia, and lichens grow under open P. palustris canopy. The shallow western have of the pond is vegetated by emergent graminoids (Poaceae and Cyperaceae), while the deeper eastern half is dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (Nymphaea odorata and Brasenia schreberi).","Lacustrine"

The vegetation varied from sedge meadows and alder swamps to pine and spruce forests (Ray et al., 1967; McDonald, 1984). [The city of Saltville lies within two counties, Smyth and Washington.

White Pond likely originated as a wind-excavated depression in the Sandhills. White Pond is located in a commercially managed Pinus taeda forest, and the pond and surrounding property have been managed for at least 70 years for private hunting and fishing. Pinus echinata and Pinus palustris are also present near the site. P. palustris was probably dominant prior to land clearance. Quercus falcata, Carya, and Liquidambar sytraciflua grow on the low ground surrounding the pond, as do Acer rubrum, Vaccinium, and other mesic trees and shrubs. On exposed sandy soils east of the lake, Quercus laevis, Ceratiola ericoides, Selaginella arenicola, Opuntia, and lichens grow under open P. palustris canopy. The shallow western have of the pond is vegetated by emergent graminoids (Poaceae and Cyperaceae), while the deeper eastern half is dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (Nymphaea odorata and Brasenia schreberi).","Lacustrine"
