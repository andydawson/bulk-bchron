Mitkof Island is separated from the west flank of the Coast Mountains of southeastern Alaska and by Frederick Sound to the east and north. Kupreanof Island lies immediately west of Mitkof Island. Surrounding vegetation: Most of Mitkof Island is covered by Pacific coastal rainforest interspersed with muskeg (bog and fen peatlands). The most common tree species on the island are western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). Mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) is common, particularly in upland forests. Also present are shore pine (Pinus. contorta ssp. contorta), yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), and occasional red cedar (Thuja plicata). Red alder trees (Alnus rubra) and Sitka alder shrubs (Alnus crispa ssp. sinuata) are important elements of the island's vegetation. Red alder trees are common in lowlands, while Sitka alder shrubs often form dense thickets along rocky coastlines, along stream banks, in avalanche scars, at forest edges, and in the subalpine zone.","Palustrine"

Tsuga mertensiana is found in the watershed on shaded more mesic slopes. Alnus sinuata, Chrysolepis chrysophylla, Rubus parviflorus, Sorbus, and Lonicera conjugialis are common shrubs around the lake.","Cirque Lake"

White Pond is located in a commercially managed Pinus taeda forest, and the pond and surrounding property have been managed for at least 70 years for private hunting and fishing. Pinus echinata and Pinus palustris are also present near the site. P. palustris was probably dominant prior to land clearance. Quercus falcata, Carya, and Liquidambar sytraciflua grow on the low ground surrounding the pond, as do Acer rubrum, Vaccinium, and other mesic trees and shrubs. On exposed sandy soils east of the lake, Quercus laevis, Ceratiola ericoides, Selaginella arenicola, Opuntia, and lichens grow under open P. palustris canopy. The shallow western have of the pond is vegetated by emergent graminoids (Poaceae and Cyperaceae), while the deeper eastern half is dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (Nymphaea odorata and Brasenia schreberi).","Lacustrine"

The edge of the Joe River is lined with a fringe of Rhizophora and occasional Avicennia, while the interior portions are dominated by Conocarpus associated with Laguncularia, Sabal and several species of hardwood trees and vines. Near the edge of the forest numerous ponds are formed in the dissected surface of the marsh. Here Cladium and ferns appear to be growing under adverse conditions on a higher level provided by remnant pillars of peat, suggesting a recent lowering of the original surface by erosion. Further into the marsh fewer ponds are encountered and growth of Cladium is more vigorous.","Brackish Marsh"

White Pond likely originated as a wind-excavated depression in the Sandhills. White Pond is located in a commercially managed Pinus taeda forest, and the pond and surrounding property have been managed for at least 70 years for private hunting and fishing. Pinus echinata and Pinus palustris are also present near the site. P. palustris was probably dominant prior to land clearance. Quercus falcata, Carya, and Liquidambar sytraciflua grow on the low ground surrounding the pond, as do Acer rubrum, Vaccinium, and other mesic trees and shrubs. On exposed sandy soils east of the lake, Quercus laevis, Ceratiola ericoides, Selaginella arenicola, Opuntia, and lichens grow under open P. palustris canopy. The shallow western have of the pond is vegetated by emergent graminoids (Poaceae and Cyperaceae), while the deeper eastern half is dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (Nymphaea odorata and Brasenia schreberi).","Lacustrine"

The edge of the Joe River is lined with a fringe of Rhizophora and occasional Avicennia, while the interior portions are dominated by Conocarpus associated with Laguncularia, Sabal and several species of hardwood trees and vines. Near the edge of the forest numerous ponds are formed in the dissected surface of the marsh. Here Cladium and ferns appear to be growing under adverse conditions on a higher level provided by remnant pillars of peat, suggesting a recent lowering of the original surface by erosion.

Sediments consist of loosely packed Quaternary alluvium composing eight different stratigraphic units ranging in age from upper Holocene to ~27,000 ka (McDonald, 1984). The units are primarily fluvial and lacustrine in origin and suggest periodic transitions between moist swampy areas and drier fluvial systems as evidenced by cycles of peaty muds and silty–sandy clays. The vegetation varied from sedge meadows and alder swamps to pine and spruce forests (Ray et al., 1967; McDonald, 1984). [The city of Saltville lies within two counties, Smyth and Washington.

Surrounding vegetation: Low-elevation forests in the region are dominated by Picea glauca, P. mariana, Pinus contorta, Betula papyrifera, and Populus tremuloides. With increasing elevation, forest cover gradually grades into forest-tundra. Above treeline, vegetation surrounding Sunset Lake is dominated by Betula glandulosa. Dwarf shrubs (Cassiope tetragona, Dryas integrifolia, Arctostaphylos, and Vaccinium) also occur, but their densities are low. An assortment of herbs, including Oxyria digyna, Potentilla uniflora, Poaceae, bryophytes, and lichens are also present. Salix often occurs near the edge of the lakes and along streams. A few dwarfed Picea glauca are growing along the shore of the lake. ","Glacial Origin Lake"

White Pond is located in a commercially managed Pinus taeda forest, and the pond and surrounding property have been managed for at least 70 years for private hunting and fishing. Pinus echinata and Pinus palustris are also present near the site. P. palustris was probably dominant prior to land clearance. Quercus falcata, Carya, and Liquidambar sytraciflua grow on the low ground surrounding the pond, as do Acer rubrum, Vaccinium, and other mesic trees and shrubs. On exposed sandy soils east of the lake, Quercus laevis, Ceratiola ericoides, Selaginella arenicola, Opuntia, and lichens grow under open P. palustris canopy. The shallow western have of the pond is vegetated by emergent graminoids (Poaceae and Cyperaceae), while the deeper eastern half is dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (Nymphaea odorata and Brasenia schreberi).","Lacustrine"
